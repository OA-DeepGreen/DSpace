# DepositOnce

[DepositOnce](https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de) is the institutional repository of [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de). It is based on [DSpace](https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace). This branch contains the derived source code we use at TU Berlin, containing all our local changes and customizations. While we try to give back as much source code as possible to DSpace, sometimes we lack the time to do so, sometimes we think our changes are too specific to be ported back to the main line. More information about DSpace can be found on [http://www.dspace.org](http://www.dspace.org) and in [DSpace's official git repository](https://www.github.com/DSpace/DSpace).
